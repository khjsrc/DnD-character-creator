    <raceInfo>
      <description>Your race is one of the races of this world.</description>
      <age>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</age>
      <alignment>Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.</alignment>
      <size brief="Medium">Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</size>
      <speed brief="30">Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</speed>
      <language brief="Common, Draconic" amount="2">You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</language>
      <uniqueTraits>
        <trait name="Draconic Ancestry">You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

Dragon	DamageType	Breath Weapon
Black	  Acid		    5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Blue    Lightning	  5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Brass	  Fire		    5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Bronze	Lightning	  5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Copper	Acid		    5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Gold	  Fire		    15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
Green 	Poison		  15 ft. cone (Con. save)
Red 	  Fire		    15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
Silver	Cold		    15 ft. cone (Con. save)
White	  Cold		    15 ft. cone (Con. save)
        </trait>
        <trait name="Breath Weapon">You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</trait>
        <trait name="Damage Resistance">You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</trait>

      <description>Your race is one of the races of this world.</description>
      <age>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</age>
      <alignment>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</alignment>
      <size brief="Medium">Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</size>

        <trait name="Trance">Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</trait>

        <description>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&#38;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
    	The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</description>

In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.
